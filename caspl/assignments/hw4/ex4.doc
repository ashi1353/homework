word.

    RTS

    What happens if we execute an instruction JSR F, with D0=0? D0=1, D0=2? 
    Other values of D0 (call that value k)?

    D0=0:
        We push 0 to the stack, subtract 2 from D0 which results in -2. It's
        negative so we jump to N, pop 0 to D0 and set D2=2.
        D0=0, D2=2.

    D0=1:
        Same as D0=0 (push 1 pop 1), just that we end up with D0=1.
        D0=1, D2=2.

    D0=2:
        Push 2 to the stack, subtract 2 from D0 which results in 0. It's -not-
        negative so we recursively call F with D0=0, which results in D0=0 and
        D2=2 from our previous calculations.
        We then pop 2 from the stack and adding it to D2, which results in
        D2=2+2=4, add D2 to itself, which results in
        D2=2*D2=2*4=8. Result: D0=0, D2=8.

    D0=k:
        In general, we push k to the stack, subtract 2 from D0 which results in
        D0=k-2, and while k >= 2 we recursively call F with D0=k-2, until D0=0
        or D0=1 which results in D0=0, D2=2, and then we recurse back, adding
        that step's D0 starting value to D2, and then multiply it.
        The result in D2 is the recursion:
            a_0 = 2
            a_1 = 2
            a_k = 2*(k+a_(k-2)) = 2k+2a_(k-2)

        D0=0, D2=a_D0

    Option (3) will result in the fastest execution (70 seconds):
    (1) will reduce the execution of both parameters by 20%, so in total it will
    now run in 80 seconds instead of 100 seconds.

    (2) will reduce the execution of MMX instructions by 30%, so it will execute
    in 56 seconds instead of 80 seconds, and with the arithmetic still taking 20
    seconds we are down to, in total, 76 seconds of execution.

    (3) will reduce MMX by 50%, from 80 seconds to 40 seconds, and increase
    arithmetic by 50% from 20 seconds to 30 seconds, and in total - 40+30 = 70
    seconds.

12.
    The best optimization to MMX will result in a 75% improvement, from 4 cycles
    per instruction to 1 cycle.
    So, from 80 seconds we get 80*0.25 = 20, and in total, with the arithmetic
    execution time, we end up with 40 seconds execution time.

    In general:
    x1, x2, x3, .., xn, 0
    1   1
    ----------------
    x1 XOR 1, x2 XOR 1, x3, .., xn, 0


    if x1 x2 = 11, both get turned off, resulting in number of bits set to
        decrease by 2.
    if x1 x2 = 10 or 01, they switch to 01 and 10 accordingly, resulting in
        number of bits set to be unchanged.

    if x1 x2 = 00, they are left unchanged, so the number of bits set doesn't
        change.

    Bottom line: we may decrease the number of bits set by 2, but never less or
    more, so the number we end up with has the same parity as the original
    number. Also, since the algorithm will continue until the first n-1 bits are
    0, we are left only with 1 bit of remainder. Since it has the same
    parity as the original number, if it's 0 the number of bits set was even,
    and if it's 1 it was odd. This is exactly like the even parity algorithm.

    c. 0x8 = 8
    d. The program header table starts at offset 0x34 (and of course, the first
    program header). Looking at that offset, we can see the program header type
    is 6 = PT_PHDR, which specifies the location and
    size of the program header table itself, both in the file and in the memory
    image of the program.

    Nothing, since i is decreased to 1 on the first while, and each child
    forks from that point, having i=1, the condition (i&2) will never be
    satisified (the 2nd bit in i is never set).
    The answer is, of course, unique.
